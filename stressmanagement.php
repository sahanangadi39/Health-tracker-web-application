            <h1>Building a Stress-Resilient Lifestyle</h1>

            <P>Managing stress is about creating a lifestyle that promotes calm and stability. Prioritise self-care by setting boundaries,
                maintaining a healthy diet, and ensuring you get enough sleep. Connecting with loved ones or seeking professional help
                when needed provides emotional support during tough times. By mastering stress management, you can lead a healthier,
                more balanced, and fulfilling life.</P>

            <h1>The Mind-Body Connection</h1>

            <p>Stress doesn't just affect your moodâ€”it impacts your body too. Prolonged stress can lead to fatigue, high blood pressure,
                and weakened immunity. Regular physical activity, yoga, or even a short walk outdoors can help release stress and
                improve your overall health. Incorporating relaxation techniques like meditation or progressive muscle relaxation
                supports both mind and body in staying balanced and energized.</p>
